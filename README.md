# SUVAT-equation-solver
A calculator for Newtonian dynamics

Upon running the program, the user is prompted to input the values of the following variables,
1. Initial velocity (u) 
2. Final velocity (v) 
3. Acceleration (a) 
4. Time (t) 
5. Distance (s)

if the user inputs values for only 2 or less variables then the program would warn them that 
there is not enough information to calculate the remaining variables.

When the user provides 3 inputs, the program then automatically calculates the remaining two unknown vairables.

When provided with 4 variables, the program either calculates the remaining variable or 
warns the user that the four varibles provided are inconsistent with each other.

In case all five variables are provided by the user, the program simply checks the consistency
of the data and informs the user if they are consistent or not.
